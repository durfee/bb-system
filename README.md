# Blaseball Design System
> Standardization of our colours, spacing, etc, to be used across both react native and react vanilla

## Usage
### Typescript
```ts
import { tokens } from "@blaseball/blaseball-system";

console.log(tokens.colors.LATacos.100);
```

## Credit where credit is due
Lots of core functionality (build scripts, file structure, and naming terminology) was grabbed from Shopify's polaris (h/t).
